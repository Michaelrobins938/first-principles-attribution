# Attribution Executive Summary

## Overview

This analysis uses a hybrid Markov-Shapley attribution model (alpha=0.5) to allocate conversion value across marketing channels. The model combines **causal measurement** (Markov chains) with **fair allocation** (Shapley values).

## Key Findings

### Top Performer
**Search** is the leading channel with **42%** of attributed conversions. The 90% confidence interval is **35%-49%**, indicating high stability in this ranking.

### Channel Rankings

| Rank | Channel | Attribution | Confidence |
|------|---------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | Search | 42% | 85% stable |
| 2 | Email | 25% | 78% stable |
| 3 | Direct | 18% | 65% stable |
| 4 | Social | 10% | - |
| 5 | Display | 5% | - |

### Budget Implications
- **Search** shows strongest contribution - maintain or increase investment
- **Email** and **Direct** show stable performance
- Lower-tier channels may need optimization or reallocation

## Methodology Note

Results include **90% confidence intervals** from bootstrap resampling (n=10,000 samples). This provides uncertainty quantification, unlike traditional last-touch attribution.
